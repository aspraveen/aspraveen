- Since the turn of the millennium, during the dot-com era, I have been actively involved in numerous web and e-commerce projects. My core technology stack comprises Python, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. I developed a strong affinity for Laravel since my initial engagement with the framework. Furthermore, I've gained experience in utilizing ASP.NET C# and SQL Server for select projects.
