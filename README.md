- Since the year 2000 (the dot-com era), I have worked on many web and e-commerce projects. My primary technological stack includes Python, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL. I am a big fan of Laravel since I started working with it. I have also worked with ASP.NET C# and SQL Server for a few clients.
- Currently, my main focus is helping companies and enterprises develop, implement, and manage their cloud architecture.
