- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Praveen and I work as a software engineer as well as a technical consultant. Since Y2K, I have worked on several projects focusing on business improvements, customer service and value delivery.
- Cloud Computing and experimenting with new technology are two things I am passionate about. Although, I've worked with different technologies over my career. Presently, my focus is on JAMstack especially NodeJS, ReactJS, NextJS and Prisma.
